# Build a De-Coupled Full Stack App: CRUD todo

We'll be using:
* Server:
  * postgres for our database
  * knex.js for our database migrations, seeds and queries.
  * express.js for our JSON routes
* Client:
  * jQuery for DOM/AJAX
  * boostrap for our UI

The code is here: https://github.com/w3cj/Full-Stack-JavaScript-CRUD/tree/part-3-de-coupled
